        <h2>FabLab</h2>
        <p> - So what is FabLab? Well, to briefly introduce what FabLab is, by breaking down the name itself you get Fabrication Laboratory, and it is exactly what you think it is. It is a space for people to fabricate items, akin to a workshop space.
            A FabLab is typically well equipped with various machines and tools to aid the fabrication process, such as 3D printers, Laser Cutting machines, soldering irons etc. With such tools available at our disposal, it has become very convenient to realize our ideas and projects easily.
            The concept of FabLab was first conceived way back in 2001 by a MIT professor named Neil Garshenfeld, who wanted an accessible and affordable make space (or maker space, same thing) for all to use. The idea eventually spread, and now there are numerous FabLabs around the world, including the ones in SP! SP by itself has numerous labs scattered around campus, with the ones at T14 and the Makerspace at the Library being quite well known.

        <h2>Basic Fablab Safety</h2>
        <p> - Fablab may not seem very dangerous, but a wrong move can set off accidents or damage apparatus in the lab, which can be very costly and cause inconveience to others due to machine down time. Hence, a basic understanding of safety is required in the lab, as well as learning how to utilize the machines in the lab properly and to our fulllest advantage.</p>
        <p> - In SP, in order to use the machines, mainly Laser Cutting and 3D printers, one must undergo some learning and tests, then pass said tests in order to earn the right to use the machines freely.</p>
        <p> - The very first quiz that must be taken is the FabLab Safety quiz, which teaches one about the risks in FabLab as well as some ettiquette on lab usage. This is the most basic test you must pass to access other content.</p>
        <p> - Once the safety quiz has been completed, one can now access the quizzes for the two main machines, 3D printers and Laser Cutting.</p>
        <p> - For 3D printing, one must go through the online lesson and pass the quiz to earn the basic qualification to use the machine.</p>
        <p> - However, for Laser cutting, in addition to the online quizzes, one must go through an additional test in the form of a practical one, to fully ensure that one knows how to operate the machine properly and safely, as well as learn some tips and tricks from the lab staff there.</p>
        <p> - After passing both trials, the labs are basically yours to use! However, if you wish to use a machine, you must book time slots via the FLMS (FabLab Management System) to reserve the machines, and is on a first-come-first-serve basis.
