    <h2>Creating a website through Github</h2>
    <p2>Our very first assignment for the module! To be honest, I did not expect for this module to include coding an entire website but here we are. Now, lets get into the details of how I managed to set this page up with barely any prior coding experience.</p2>
   
    <div>
    <h3>Github and repository creation</h3>
    <p2>First off, since we are hosting a website on Github, we are going to need a Github account to make a repository. </p2>
    <p2>After signing up, we are now able to freely use Github and its functions.</p2>
    </div>

    <div>
    <p>From the repository page, you can create a new one by simply clicking the "New" button.</p>
    <p>In the creation page, give the repository a name, add a README and license and you're good to go!</p>
    <p>Since we are hosting a website, do remember to set the repository to public so people can actually access and view our website.</p>
    <p>Use the "Add file" button to add files to your repository so that it will function. In this case, since we are creating a website, we need to add HTML files. Do make sure to create a HTML file called "index.html", this will serve as your homepage for your website.</p>
   </div> 

   <div>
    <h3>Website Creation (the actual part)</h3>
    <p>Now, we need to host our repository through Github. This is done through Github Pages.</p>
    <p>In the repository, go to Settings, then scroll down the side bar and click "Pages".</p>
    <p>Upon entering, you will see the URL to your page.</p>
    
   </div>

   <div>
    <h3>Updating and subsequent actions</h3>
    <p>Now that you have your page up and running, you're going to want to update and add more content to it. To do this, we are going to use Github Desktop.</p>
    <p>After installing Github Desktop, log into your Github and clone the repository. Now, you can add updates to your website through the app. Do make sure to connect your repository to your code editor of choice. I used Notepad++ at first, but switched to Visual Studio Code at the recommendation of a friend.</p>
    <p>After making any changes to your files, make sure to save. Then using the app, click "Commit to main" and "Push to Origin". This will apply any changes you make to your website.</p>
    <p>In the event you messed up the code and need to revert changes, the app has a function to roll back to a previous save. This will save you from the trouble of wrangling with the mess you accidentally made.</p>
    <p>Now, all that's left to do is constantly update the site in accordance to the weeks and assignments that is assigned, and make the website look pretty and user-friendly through the use of CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) code!</p>
