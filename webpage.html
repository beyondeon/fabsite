    <h2>Creating a website through Github (Assignment 1)</h2>
    <ul>
    <li>Our very first assignment for the module! To be honest, I did not expect for this module to include coding an entire website but here we are. Now, lets get into the details of how I managed to set this very page up with barely any prior coding experience.</li>
    </ul>
</div>

    <h3>Github and repository creation</h3>
 <ol>
    <li style="margin-bottom:8px;">First off, since we are hosting a website on Github, we are going to need a Github account to make a repository. </li>
    <li style="margin-bottom:8px;">After signing up, I am now able to freely use Github and its functions.</li>
    <li style="margin-bottom:8px;">From the repository page, you can create a new one by simply clicking the "New" button.</li>
    <li style="margin-bottom:8px;">In the creation page, give the repository a name, add a README and license and you're good to go!</li>
    <li style="margin-bottom:8px;">Since we are hosting a website, we need to set the repository to public so people can actually access and view our website.</li>
    <li style="margin-bottom:8px;">Use the "Add file" button to add files to your repository so that it will function. In this case, since we are creating a website, we need to add HTML files. I made sure to create a HTML file called "index.html", as this will serve as my homepage for the website.</li>
 </ol>
</div>

<div>
    <h3>Website Creation (the actual part)</h3>
 <ol>
    <li style="margin-bottom:8px;">Now, I need to host my repository through Github. This was done through Github Pages.</li>
    <li style="margin-bottom:8px;">In the repository, go to Settings, then scroll down the side bar and click "Pages".</li>
    <li style="margin-bottom:8px;">Upon entering, I can create the URL to my page.</li>
 </ol>
</div>

<div>
    <h3>Updating and subsequent actions</h3>
 <ol>
    <li style="margin-bottom:8px;">Now that I had my page up and running, I'll need to update and add more content to it. To do this, we used Github Desktop.</p>
    <li style="margin-bottom:8px;">After installing Github Desktop, logged into my Github and cloned the repository. Now, I can add updates to my website through the app. Do make sure to connect your repository to your code editor of choice. I used Notepad++ at first, but switched to Visual Studio Code at the recommendation of a friend.</li>
    <li style="margin-bottom:8px;">After making any changes to your files, make sure to save. Then using the app, click "Commit to main" and "Push to Origin". This will apply any changes you make to your website.</li>
    <li style="margin-bottom:8px;">In the event I messed up the code and need to revert changes, the app has a function to roll back to a previous save. This will save me from the trouble of wrangling with the mess I accidentally made.</li>
    <li style="margin-bottom:8px;">Now, all that's left to do is constantly update the site in accordance to the weeks and assignments that is assigned, and make the website look pretty and user-friendly through the use of CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) code!</li>
 </ol>
