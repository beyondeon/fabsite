  <h2>3D CAD</h2>
    <ul>
    <li>So what is 3D CAD? First off, CAD means "Computer Aided Drawing", and it is used to create and modify virtual models in both 3D and 2D. In this case, it would be well, 3D. </li>
    <li>So just what is it used for? For one, 3D CAD is very useful and is basically one of the fundamentals to digital fabrication (hey that's the name of the module). 3D CAD is how we produce 3D models to print via 3D printers to realise our designs.</li>
    <li>Various software for 3D CAD exist, with some examples being Autodesk Inventor, Autodesk Fusion 360 and even Blender. For our purposes, I will be using Fusion 360 for the majority of the module.</li>
    <li>I have prior experience with CAD software as I am from an engineering course, namely Autodesk Inventor for 3D. However, Inventor and Fusion 360 have their own differences, so this is also a learning experience for me.</li>
    </ul>

  <h2>Exercise 1</h2>
  <p>For this first 3D CAD exercise, we are actually not going to make a 3D model right away. We are going actually going to make a sketch, which is the backbone of all 3D models in CAD software. Sketches allow designers to easily define dimensions and edit the shapes of the model. Only after making a sketch then are we able to extrude them in order to create a 3D model.</p>
  <p>We are going to sketch this in Fusion 360.</p>
  <img src="images/sketch.png" alt="Sketch picture" width="300" height="400">
  <p>First, we will click on the "Create Sketch" button, then select a plane to start the sketch on.</p>
  <p>Then, we can start sketching. I started with a rectangle. By default, the rectangle is a 2 point one, but by using the "Create" dropdown menu, we can select different types of rectangles. We will be using the center point one here.</p>
  <img src="images/rectangle.png" alt="rectangle sketch" width="500" height="500">
  <p>For sketches, we preferably want them to be fully constrained, usually to the origin. Constraining basically "locks" the sketch, so that the sketch cannot be accidentally altered and is indicated by black lines. Hence, the center point of the rectangle is right smack at the origin. This makes it constrained.</p>
  <p>To specify dimensions, you can key in values into the box which appears when you apply an item. For multiple values, you can use [tab] to alternate between them.</p>
  <p>We shall now add the remaining shapes.</p>
  <img src="images/circles.png" alt="circle sketch" width="500" height="500">
  <img src="images/guides.png" alt="trimmed sketch" width="500" height="500">
  <p>Here, we added some construction lines for the inner rectangle, and trimmed the rectangle and the inside of the outermost circle. Trimming the rectangle however caused the sketch to be unconstrained.</p>
  <img src="images/complete.png" alt="complete sketch" width="950" height="500">
  <p>After adding the final rectangle, we are now done with the sketch! Unfortunately, it is not constrained hence the blue lines, but I am still able to extrude the sketch. This however has the risk of causing issues further down if sudden changes are made, or as Fusion calls it, "downstream failures".</p>
  <p>In any case, this exercise is done! On to the next one!</p>
